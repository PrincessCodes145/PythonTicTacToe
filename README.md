  A brief overview of the TicTacToe code I created using Python :

1. Introduction and Setup:
   - The game welcomes the player and sets up the game board with numbers 1 to 9.
   - ANSI escape codes are defined to color 'X' in green and 'O' in yellow.

2. Game Board Display:
   - The printGameBoard() function prints the current state of the game board with appropriate colors for 'X' and 'O'.

3. Modify Game Board:
   - The modifyArray() function updates the game board based on the player's or computer's move.

4. Check for Winner:
   - The CheckWinner() function checks if there is a winner by evaluating rows, columns, and diagonals.

5. Player and CPU Turns:
   - The playerTurn() function handles the player's move, allowing them to choose a number or quit the game.
   - The cpuTurn() function randomly selects a move for the computer.

6. Main Game Loop:
   - The main() function prompts the player to choose between Player vs Player and Player vs Computer modes.
   - The game alternates turns between players or between the player and the computer.
   - The game checks for a winner after each turn and ends the game if a winner is found or if the player chooses to quit.

This code provides a simple yet interactive Tic Tac Toe game with options to play against another player or the computer, and it includes a feature to exit the game at any time.
